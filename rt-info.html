    <h1>What is a Reference Transaction?</h1><br>

    <p>The PayPal Reference Transactions API enables a customer and merchant to enter into a contract, or a billing
        agreement,
        based on reference transactions. A reference transaction is a financial transaction that you initiate through a
        billing
        agreement and from which you can derive subsequent payments.
